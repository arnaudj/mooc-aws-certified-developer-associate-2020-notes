# AWS Lambda

Why use AWS Lambda?
- Avoid limitations of EC2 Servers:
    - Virtual Servers in the Cloud
    - Limited by RAM and CPU
    - Continuously running
    - Scaling means intervention to add / remove servers
- Lambda provides:
    - Virtual functions
    - no servers to manage
    - Quick, short executions
    - Run on-demand
    - Scaling is fully automated

## Benefits of AWS Lambda

- Easy Pricing:
- Pay per request and compute time
- Free tier of 1,000,000 AWS Lambda requests and 400,000 GBs of compute time
- Integrations with the entire AWS Stack
- Integrated with many programming languages
- Easy monitoring through AWS CloudWatch
- Easy to get more resources per functions (up to 3GB of RAM)
- Increasing RAM will also improve CPU and network

AWS Lambda language support:
- Node.js (JavaScript)
- Python
- Java (Java 8 compatible) â€¢ C# (.NET Core)
- Golang
- C# / Powershell

## AWS Lambda pricing

- You can find overall pricing information here: https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/
- Pay per calls:
- First 1,000,000 requests are free
- $0.20 per 1 million requests thereafter ($0.0000002 per request)
- Pay per duration: (in increment of 100ms)
- 400,000 GB-seconds of compute time per month if FREE
- == 400,000 seconds if function is 1GB RAM
- == 3,200,000 seconds if function is 128 MB RAM
- After that $1.00 for 600,000 GB-seconds
- It is usually very cheap to run AWS Lambda which makes it very popular

## AWS Lambda configuration

- Timeout: default 3 seconds, max of 300s (Note: new limit 15 minutes) - Environment variables
- Allocated memory (128M to 3G)
- Ability to deploy within a VPC + assign security groups
- IAM execution role must be attached to the Lambda function

## AWS Lambda Synchronous Invocation

- Result of the function is returned right away
- Synchronous invocation happens when the function is invoked as follows:
    - User invoked:
        - ELB (Application Load Balancer)
        - API Gateway
        - CloudFront
        - S3 Batch
        - CLI
        - SDK

    - Service invoked:
        - Cognito
        - Step Functions

    - Invoked from other services:
        - Amazon Lex
        - Alexa
        - Kinesis Data Firehose

- Error handling must be done on the client side
- Invoke function from a command line:

```
aws lambda invoke --function-name hello-world --cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out --payload '{}' --region eu-west-2 response.json 
```

### Lambda integration with ELB (ALB)

    - Used for exposing a HTTP(S) endpoint
    - The function must be registered in a target group
    - HTTP request is converted by the ALB to JSON and the JSON is passed to the function an input
    - The ALB converts the lambda response back to JSON
    - Multi-header values: by default they are disabled. When enabled HTTP headers and query string parameters that are sent with multiple values are shown as arrays within the Lambda event and response object

### Lambda@Edge

- Lambda function deployed synchronously from CDN using CloudFront
- Used for running global AWS Lambda function alongside CDN
- Can be used for request filtering before reaching the final application
- Can change CloudFront requests and responses:
    - After CloudFront receives a request from viewer (view request)
    - Before CloudFront forwards a request to origin (origin request)
    - After CloudFront receives the response from the origin (origin response)
    - Before CloudFront forwards the response to the viewer (viewer response)
- Use cases:
    - Website security and privacy
    - Dynamic web application at the Edge
    - Search engine optimization (SEO)
    - Intelligent route across origins and data centers
    - Bot mitigation at the Edge
    - Real-time image transformation
    - A/B testing
    - User authentication/authorization
    - User prioritization
    - User tracking and analytics

## AWS Lambda Asynchronous Invocation

- Mainly invoked after a certain event
- The events are placed in an internal event queue
- Automatic retry: 3 retries: first one right after failure, second one waits 1 minute, third one after 2 minutes (exponential backoff)
- Lambda function should be idempotent - in case of retries the result should be the same
- Retries can cause duplicate log entries in CloudWatch logs
- DQL: in case of failure after retries the lambda function can send an event to SNS or SQS
- Services that invoke async lambda functions:
    - S3
    - SNS
    - CloudWatch Events / EventBridge
    - CodeCommit
    - CodePipeline
    - CloudWatch Logs
    - Amazon Simple Email Service
    - CloudFormation
    - Amazon Config
    - Amazon IoT / Iot Events
- Invoke a function asynchronously from CLI:

```
aws lambda invoke --function-name hello-world --cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out --payload '{}' --region eu-west-2 --invocation-type Event response.json 
```

- Invocation from CloudWatch Events/EventBridge:
    - serverless CRON job
    - CodePipeline state change

- Invocation from S3 events:
    - Events: *S3:ObjectCreated*, *S3:ObjectRemoved*, etc.
    - Possible to de object filtering by name (*.jpg)
    - Possible use case: generate thumbnails for newly uploaded images
    - S3 event notification typically deliver events in seconds, sometimes it can take longer
    - If two writes are happening on a single, non-versioned object at the same time, it is possible that only one event gets delivered (solution: enable versioning on the S3 bucket)

## AWS Lambda Event Source Mapping

- Records needs to be polled from the source
- Applies to SQS queues, Kinesis Data Streams, DynamoDB Streams
- Lambda function is invoked synchronously
- 2 categories of event source mapper:
    - Streams (Kinesis Data Streams, DynamoDB):
        - Event source creates an iterator for each shard so data can be processed in order
        - New items, from beginning or timestamp
        - Processed items are not removed from the stream
        - Low traffic: use batch window
        - High traffic: multiple batches can be processed in parallel. Up to 10 batch processes per shard, in-order processing for each partition key
        - Errors: the entire batch is reprocessed in case of an error until the function succeeds or the items in the batch expire
        - Configure event source mapping to handle errors:
            - discard old events
            - restrict number of retries
            - split the batch on error (mainly used in case of timeout issues)
            - discarded events can go to a *Destination*
    - Queues (SQS):
        - Event source mapping uses long polling to poll the queue
        - Batch size: 1-10 messages
        - Recommendation: set the queue visibility to *6x the timeout of the Lambda function*
        - DLQ: set-up the DLQ on the queue, not on the Lambda
        - Lambda supports FIFO queues, scaling up to the number of active message groups
        - Lambda scales up to process a standard queue as fast as possible
        - In case of error batches are returned as individual items => they might be process as part of different batch
        - Idempotent processing in case of duplicates
        - Lambda deletes the processed items from the queue
- Scaling:
    - Data streams:
        - One Lambda invocation per each shard
        - Parallelization: up to 10 batches per shard in the same time
    - Queues:
        - Lambda adds 60 more instances per minute to scale up
        - Up to 1000 batches of messages simultaneously
    - FIFO queues:
        - Messages within the same group are processed in order
        - Lambda scales to the number of the message groups

## AWS Lambda Destinations

- Configure to send result of a function to a destination
- Async invocations destinations for successful and failed events can be sent to:
    - SQS
    - SNS
    - Other Lambda
    - EventBridge bus
- Use destination instead of DLQ (even if both can be used at the same time)
- In case of event source mapping: for discarded batches, event baches can be sent to SQS and SNS

## IAM Roles for Lambda

- Grants permission to Lambda to access other AWS services (obviously :)
- When we use an event source mapping to invoke a function, Lambda uses the execution role to read event data.
- Best practice: one execution role per function
- Lambda resource based policy: give other accounts of AWS services to use Lambda resources
- IAM principal can access Lambda:
    - if the IAM policy attached to the principal authorizes it
    - if the resource based policy authorizes

## Environment Variables

- Env. variable =  key / value pair
- Adjust the system behavior
- Env. variables are available to the function code
- Lambda has its own env. variables
- Env. variables can be encrypted (KMS), useful for secrets

## Logging / Monitoring

- Integration with CloudWatch logs if the lambda has the IAM policy
- CloudWatch Metrics:
    - Information about invocation, duration, concurrent execution
    - Error count, success rate, throttles
    - Failures
    - Iterators for streams
- Tracing with X-Ray using X-Ray SDK in code
- Env. variables for X-Ray:
    - **_X_AMZN_TRACE_ID**
    - **AWS_XRAY_CONTEXT_MISSING**
    - **AWS_XRAY_DAEMON_ADDRESS** -  X-Ray Daemon *IP_ADDRESS:PORT*

## Networking

- By default: Lambda is launched outside of user VPC, so it can not access resources from inside of a private VPC
- Lambda can be deployed in a VPC:
    - Lambda will create a ENI (Elastic Network Interface)
    - Needed *AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole*
- By default: Lambda in an user defined VPC can not access internet (even if the VPC is public). Solution: NAT Gateway / Instance, Lambda deployed in a private subnet
- DynamoDB can be accessed via VPC endpoints (or via public internet)
- CloudWatch logs work in private subnet without NAT

## Configuration / Performance

- RAM:
    - Can be scaled from 128MB to 3008MB in 64MB increments
    - The more RAM we add, the more vCPU credit we get (vCPU can not be configured separately)
    - Ath 1792MB a function has the equivalent of a full vCPU
    - After this value we get more than one vCPU, multi-threaded code can leverage this
- Timeout: by default 3 seconds, max 900 seconds (15 minutes)
- Execution context:
    - Temporary runtime env. that initializes any external dependency
    - Great for DB connections, HTTP clients
    - Is maintained for some time in anticipation of another Lambda invocation
    - Does include the **/tmp** directory (512MB disk space)
    - Recommended: initialize DB connections outside of function handler, it can be reused for next execution
    - For permanent persistence use S3 (not /tmp)!
- Concurrency:
    - Limit: up to 1000 concurrent executions per account
    - Reserved concurrency creates a pool of requests that can only be used by its function, and also prevents its function from using unreserved concurrency
    - Invocation over concurrency limit will trigger throttle
    - Throttle behavior:
        - Sync invocation => return ThrottleError - 429
        - Async invocation => automatic retry and DLQ
    - If higher limit is required per account, open a support ticket
    - In case of reserved concurrency not set, one function could throttle other function, max concurrency limit is applied globally to a single account 
    - In case of async invocation Lambda will attempt to run the function again for 6 hours. The retry interval increases exponentially
    - Cold start: in case of a new function instance, first request can take longer because of initialization
    - Provisioned concurrency initializes a requested number of execution environments so that they are prepared to respond to your function's invocations => no cold start!
    - Application Auto Scaling can manage concurrency (schedule or target utilization)

## External Dependencies

- Dependencies, packages need to be installed together with Lambda code (zip package)
- Zip can be uploaded to Lambda if it has less than 50MB. Otherwise use S3
- Native libraries need to be compiled on Amazon Linux
- AWS SDK comes together with every Lambda function

## CloudFormation

- Code can be defined in-line (for very simple functions)
- Inline functions can not include dependencies
- For more complex functions:
    - We can use the **Code.ZipFile** property
    - We can use S3 where we should refer to the location of the zip file in a bucket
        - Note: if we update the code in S3 but don't update the S3Bucket, S3Key or S3ObjectVersion in the template, CloudFormation wont update the function, **versioning is import**

## AWS Lambda Layers

- Custom Runtimes for Lambda, example:
    - C++ [https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-cpp](aws-lambda-cpp)
    - Rust [https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime](aws-lambda-rust)
- Externalize dependencies to re-use them in case of bigger
dependency packages
- Another function could reuse layers

## AWS Lambda Versions and Aliases

- When we work on a Lambda function, we work on *$LATEST* version
- When we are ready to publish, we create a new version
- Versions are immutable (can not change to code, env. variables of anything after a version is published)
- Versions have increasing number
- Each version is independent and it gets its own ARN
- Each version of the lambda can be accessed
- Alias:
    - Pointer to a Lambda function version
    - We can defined dev, test, prod aliases which can point to different versions
    - Aliases are mutable
    - Aliases enable Blue/Green deployment by assigning weights to Lambda functions
    - Aliases enable stable configurations of our event triggers/destinations
    - Aliases have their own ARN
    - **Aliases can not reference other aliases!**

## CodeDeploy

- Can help automate traffic shift for Lambda aliases
- Feature is integrated within SAM framework
- Traffic shifting methodologies:
    - Linear growth: traffic grows every N minutes until 100%
    - Canary: try X percent then 100%
    - AllAtOnce: immediate (quickest, most dangerous)
    - Rollback: can create pre and post traffic hooks to check the health of the Lambda function

## AWS Lambda Limits

- Execution:
    - Memory: 128MB -  3008MB (64MB increments)
    - Max execution time: 900 seconds (15 minutes)
    - Env. variables: 4KB
    - Disk space (/tmp): 512MB
    - Concurrent executions 1000 per account

- Deployments:
    - Compressed: 50MB
    - Uncompressed (code + dependencies): 250MB
    - Can use /tmp to load other files at startup

## Best practices

- Perform heavy-duty work outside of the function handler
- Use env. variables for anything that changes over time
- Minimize deployment package size to its runtime necessities
- **Avoid recursive code, never have a Lambda function call itself!**
