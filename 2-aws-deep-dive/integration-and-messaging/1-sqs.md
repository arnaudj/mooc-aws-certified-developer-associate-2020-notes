# SQS: Simple Queue Service

âœ”

SQS is a bservice that manages and operates message oriented middleware. It enables you to decouple and scale micro-services, distributed systems, and serverless applications.

What's a queue?
    - A form of asynchronous service to service communication used in multiple application architectures.
    - Messages are stored on teh queue until they are processed and deleted

## Standard Queue

- Oldest offering from AWS (over 10 years old)
- Fully managed service
- Scales from 1 message per second to 10,000 per second
- Default retention of messages: 4 days
    - A maximum of 14 days
- There is no limit to how many messages can be in the queue
- Low latency (10 ms on publish and receive)
- Horizontal scaling in terms of number of consumers
- Can have duplicate messages
- Can have messages out of order (best effort ordering)
- Limitation of 256kb per message sent

## Delay Queue

- Delay a message so a consumer doesn't see it immediately
    - up to 15 minute delay
- Default is 0 seconds making messages available right away
- You can set a default at queue level
- YOu can override the default using the **DelaySeconds** parameter

### Producing Messages

- Define the body
- Add message attributes (metadata - optional)
- Optionally can provide Delay Delivery
- You receive back:
    - Message identifier
    - MD5 hash of the body

Messages can be encrypted at rest.

### Consuming Messages

- Poll SQS for messages
    - receive up to 10 messages at a time
- Next step is to process the message within the visibility timeout
- Finally, delete the message using the message ID & receipt handle

### Visibility timeout

- When a consumer polls a message from a queue, the message is *invisible* to the other consumers for a defined period called **Visibility Timeout**
    - Can be set between 0 seconds to 12 hours
    - Default 30 seconds
    - If it takes 15 minutes or greater and consumer fails to process the message, you must wait before processing the message again
    - IF set to 30 seconds or lower and consumer needs time to process the message, another consumer will receive the message and will be processed more than once
- **ChangeMessageVisibility**
    - An API to change the visibility while processing a message
- **DeleteMessage**
    - An API to tell SQS the message was successfully processed

### Dead Letter Queue

- If a consumer fails to consume a message within the visibility timeout, the message goes back to the queue. We can put a threshold of how many times a message can be put back to the queue
- After **MaximumReceives** times the threshold is exceeded and the message goes into dead letter queue (DLQ)
    - DLQ is useful for debugging
    - Retention times for the messages should be set to max (14 days) in case of a DLQ
    - DLQ is a queue which is created separately and attached to the normal queue

### Long Polling

- When a consumer requests for a message from a queue it can optionally wait for messages to arrive in case there is no available message to be consumed in the queue
- Long polling decreases the number of API calls made to SQS while increasing the efficiency and latency of the application
- The wait time can be set to 1 second up to 20 seconds.
- Long polling should be preferred in case of short polling (wait time of 0 seconds)
- Long polling is enabled by setting a value between 1 and 20 for **WaitTimeSeconds** queue attribute

### SQS Extended Client

- Message size limit is 265KB in case of a queue, Extended Client Java library offers an implementation for larger messages using S3
- The data is uploaded into S3, the message will contain a pointer to the data. When the message is consumed, the data is retrieved from the S3 using the pointer

### SQS API

- **CreateQueue(MessageRetentionPeriod)**: creates a queue
- **DeleteQueue**: deletes a queue
- **PurgeQueue**: deletes all the messages from a queue
- **SendMessage(DelaySeconds)**: send a message with optional delay
- **ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds**: receives a message using long polling
- **ChangeMessageVisibility**: changes the message wait time in case there is more time needed for processing
- Batch API: **SendMessage**, **DeleteMessage**, **ChangeMessageVisibility**

## FIFO Queues

- FIFO = First In First Out
- Provides ordering of the messages in a queue
- Has limited throughput compared to standard queues: 300 msg/s without batching, 3000 msg/s with batching
- Exactly-once send capability
- Messages are processed in order by the consumer
- Queues which are created as FIFO should have their name ending with "fifo"

### FIFO Deduplication

- Used for making sure that a message is sent only once
- Deduplication interval is 5 minutes
- Deduplication methods:
    - Content based deduplication: the message body is hashed with SHA-256 algorithm and the hash is used to detect duplicates
    - **MessageDeduplicationID**: attribute can be set explicitly for checking duplicates

### FIFO Message Grouping

- **MessageGroupID**: if this attribute is set, a message group can have only one consumer and the messages will arrive in order for the same message group
- Provides ordering at a subset level of messages in case of a queue:
    - Messages which share the same group id arrive in order within the group
    - Each group id can have a different consumer. A queue can have multiple groups
    - Ordering across the groups are not guaranteed
